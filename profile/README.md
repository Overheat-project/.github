# Welcome to the **Overheat Project** ðŸ”¥

## Overview

#### TL;DR: Embedded Systems Innovation ðŸš€ (not really)

The Overheat Project is pushing the boundaries of real-time data collection and visualization on edge devices. Weâ€™re combining cutting-edge tech to bring you dynamic, hands-on embedded systems applications, driven by:

- **Raspberry Pi 5** with monocylar camera (because we're out of budget) and `ORB-SLAM3` for precise 3D-map modelling
- **Mobile App** for command control, data visualization, and connection insights via `Bluetooth` (which will be a pain in the ass to debug)
- **Real-Time Visualization** of RSSI, network speeds, and spatial data (not sure, you haven't heard anything)

Join us as we explore the next level of connectivity and data processing on compact, powerful hardware of Cortex-A76 CPU with 8GB of LPDDR4X SDRAM on board.

Stay tuned for updates, and welcome to the journey!
