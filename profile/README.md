# Welcome to the **Overheat Project** üî•

## What is Overheat? üöÄ

Overheat is an award-winning project that combines computer vision, embedded systems, and network analysis to create **affordable 3D WiFi coverage heatmaps**. We're solving a real problem in a creative way - professional WiFi mapping tools cost over $5,000, while our solution brings the price point down to approximately $80!

### The Problem We're Solving

Imagine trying to optimize WiFi coverage in your office or home:
- Professional tools like NetAlly AIRCHECK-G3 cost over $5,000 (532,000‚ÇΩ)
- Consumer options (phone + speedtest apps) are inaccurate and tedious
- There's nothing in between... until now!

### Our Solution

We've built a compact hardware-software system that:
1. Maps physical spaces in 3D using ORB-SLAM3 and a monocular camera
2. Measures WiFi signal strength (RSSI) and connection speed at precise locations
3. Visualizes everything as an interactive 3D heatmap on your phone
4. Makes deployment and network planning decisions easy and data-driven

1. The system **captures video** from the monocular camera
2. ORB-SLAM3 processes the feed to **build a 3D map** of the environment in real-time
3. Simultaneously, the WiFi module **measures signal strength and speed** at each location
4. All data points are **geo-tagged** with precise 3D coordinates
5. The Android app **visualizes the heatmap** overlaid on the 3D model
6. Users can **interact with the visualization** to find dead zones and optimal router placements
